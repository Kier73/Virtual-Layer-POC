# Contributing to Virtual Layer POC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Virtual Layer Dynamics (VLD)! This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Scale-Invariant Generative Logic.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Research & Feedback
As this is a mathematical and algorithmic PoC, feedback on the logic and substrate design is highly valued. Please open an issue to discuss theoretical improvements.

### 2. Code Contributions
- **Bug Fixes**: If you find an error in the RNS, Feistel, or Matrix logic, please submit a Pull Request.
- **New Tests**: We welcome additions to the `gauntlet_vld.py` or new dynamics exploration tests.
- **Porting**: If you are interested in porting this PoC to C++/CUDA for production-grade throughput, please contact the maintainer.

## Development Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run tests to ensure stability: `python tests/gauntlet_vld.py`.
3. Submit your changes via a Pull Request.
